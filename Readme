This is a small dash website to showcase data of a superstore, created based on the file "Sample - Superstore.xlsw".

To run the project, you need to install dash, dash_mantine_components, pandas,
openpyxl, dash_iconify and then run the app.py file.

I created 3 page, a home page, a page where I show the whole data table and a page that
contains a bubble chart and timeline chart.

In the home page I showed some useful information, chart and two cards that leads the user 
to the graph page and data table page per requirement.

In the table page I gave user a hierarchy dropdown selection option where user can
select the region, state and city and state options gets updated based on selected region and city
options gets updated based on selected state.

In the graph page I showed two chart, a timeline chart and a bubble chart where bubble chart had
two axis selector dropdown and a breakdown dropdown. The timeline chart also got updated as per
the axis selector dropdown option and also had a granularity dropdown at the top, where user
could filter by start and ending date and period.

Also created a sidebar for the user to navigate through the website.

The main challenge of the task was working pd and dash. I haven't worked with dash before and
I had to learn the whole flow to implement this small website. Also calculating all the values
based on the dropdown was quite challenging as I am not used to doing this kind of calculations.
But I learned a lot from this experience. Specially on how to deal with csv files in python and
how to create dashboard and chart using them.

I wish I could make it look more beautiful. But I am happy with what I've done.
